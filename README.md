<h1 align="center"> Checklist for the pre-registration of my research work </h1>   

The following checklist will be carried out according to the phases of my research project,  following the stages as if I were going to write my paper. 

<div align="center"> 🧫🧬🔬 The checklists of my research 👩🏻‍🔬👩🏻‍💻👩🏻‍🏫 ✔︎✔︎</div>

## <a id="table-of-contents"></a>1. Fungi manipulation

* □ Preparation of culture medium, checking availability of Papa Dextrose Agar (PDA) and reagents for MBS.
* □ Sterilise materials (plates, Erlenmeyer, tips) in autoclave and put in oven.
* □ Fungal reactivation, prepare all necessary materials:
	* Preserved strains
	* Sterile PDA boxes
	* Bacteriological loop
    *  Parafilm
* □ Incubate strains in PDA at controlled temperature (specify exact conditions).
* □ Confirm the purity of the culture by microscopy.
* □ Preparation of spore suspension:
	* 1% SDS
	* Blue tips
	* Glass beads
	* Sterile styled water
	* Glass fibre
	* Bacteriological loop
	* Grown strains
	* Neubauer chamber
	* Lactophenol blue
	* Slides and slides
## <a id="table-of-contents"></a>2. Methodology

*  □ Experimental design:
	* Establish controls (glucose as carbon source and medium without plastic).
	* Determine biological replicates (minimum three per treatment).
*  □ Pre-experimental set-ups ‘Temperature’:
	* Establish thermal gradients to identify optimal conditions.
	* Use standardised materials, sterile LDPE beads.
	* Document each step of the experimental process with photographs and detailed records.
* □ Set up previous ‘FTIR’ experimental set-ups:
	* Set up experimental set-up of fungal and non-fungal tempers.
	* Perform EP drying process once each phase is completed.
	* Confirm availability of equipment
	* Make a presentation with the other researchers to socialise the results.
* □ Previous experimental set-ups ‘pH’:
	* Set up experiment At optimum temperature (controls and experiments).
	* Take samples every three days to monitor specific changes.
	* Keep results in tables.
	* Make a presentation with the other researchers to socialise the results.
* □ Extraction and handling of RNA:
	* Standardisation of kits to be used.
	* Set up homogenisation (RotorStator, glass beads, liquid nitrogen, homogeniser).
	* Verify the quality of the RNA with agarose gel, spectrometer and fluorometer.
	* Store samples in appropriate conditions (-80°C or in RNAlater, depending on availability).
* □ Final assembly for transcriptome samples:
	* Use biological replicates.
	* Keep the assembly in a dark place, where they are static.
	* Take the samples at the established times and store them.
	* Store samples in appropriate conditions.
* □ Sending samples for sequencing:
	* Draw the necessary permits for shipment.
	* Organise the samples to ensure that they arrive in optimal conditions at the supplier.
 
 ## <a id="table-of-contents"></a>3. Data analysis

* □ Bioinformatics pre-processing:
* □ Run quality control of RNA reads with FastQC.
* □ Use Trimmomatic for trimming and filtering of reads.
* □ Reconstruction of the transcriptome:
* □ Use tools such as Trinity or Velvet for de novo assembly.
* □ Mapping reads with HISAT2.
* □ Differential expression:
* □ Compare treatments and controls with DESeq2.
* □ Correct p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.
* □ Gene annotation:
* □ Query GO and KEGG databases for functional interpretation.
* □ Generate graphical visualisations with R.
  
 ## <a id="table-of-contents"></a>4. Writing process

* □ Structure of the paper, following the required template.
* □ Methodology: Describe each experimental stage in detail.
* □ Results: Present graphs, tables and statistical analysis.
* □ Introduction: Contextualise the problem and justify the research.
* □ Discussion: Relate the findings to previous research.
* □ Citations and references
* □ Check format according to the standards of the target journal.
* □ Include all relevant data (DOI, URL, etc.).
* □ Pass through spelling and grammar checkers.
* □ Send to internal reviewers for comments.
* □ Prepare manuscript for publication:
* □ Adjust according to the specific guidelines of the selected journal.
* □ Draft cover letters for editors.
